**Python Website Automator**

A Python automation tool that I decided to build to streamline and simplify my day-to-day work and personal tasks. This project uses Python's libraries to automate repetitive tasks. For example, I'll use Netflix whenever I want to watch a movie and I'll have like other tasks in the background like my projects that I am working on, they'd automatically open once I run the Python script.
